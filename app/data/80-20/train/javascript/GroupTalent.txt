# AdminJS

AdminJS is a client-side administration framework for interacting with your backend.

# Development

Be sure Node.js is installed. After cloning the repo:

* `npm install`
* `grunt server`

This will start the development server and a demo app can be viewed at `http://localhost:8000`.

To build the main `adminjs.js` and `adminjs.css` files to use in your app, run `grunt build`. The results will be placed in `dist/`.
