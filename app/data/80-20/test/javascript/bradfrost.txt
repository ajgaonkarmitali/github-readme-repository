# This Version of Pattern Lab has been Discontinued 

The version of Pattern Lab available in this repository has been discontinued. It remains available in case someone wants to use it but there is another, newer [PHP version of Pattern Lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php) that will be actively maintained in the future. For more information on why there's a new version [check out our blog post](http://dmolsen.com/2013/04/25/pattern-lab-gets-a-behind-the-scenes-makeover/).
